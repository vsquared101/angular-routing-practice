# Routing Practice

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. Here the very basics of Angular routing are explained starting from how to include the router module and configure possible routes within an Angular application to how we can pass and retrieve path and query parameters via the different routes.
